# todo_app_ingressive_event
I was invited to handle a session on reading and writing from Firebase
At the Ingressive Port Harcourt Cloud Computing event
I had to create this simple project to demostrate reading and writing to Firebase at the event
I used the following concepts:
RecyclerView
Adapter
ViewHolder
Firebase Realtime Database
